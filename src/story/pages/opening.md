# Opening conversation #
  
Greeting(s),

(I place the parentheses around the above `s` to denote choice of word. Generally, it is written as `greetings`, but any actual greeting that I can think of it singular. One does not wish another person `good mornings` or say give multiple `hellos`. So to me, logically, eliding the `s` makes sense in `greetings`.)

I am `The Automaton`. You can call me `Automaton`. If you really must, you can call me fully `Automaton, The Automaton`, but I take no pride in any particular form of my name and so would not be offended if you chose to say whatever is most convenient for you.
